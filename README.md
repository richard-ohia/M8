# AfroBeats Relaxing Song - DJ Richard

## Description

This program and the music it generates seeks to provide the listener with a musical emotional journey that lasts five minutes. I wanted it to feel like Afrobeats, traditional Nigerian instruments, ensemble vocals, and electrical instruments all combined to have a baby. The hardest part was figuring out what music style should dominate the song. I chose Afrobeats and a drum-heavy instrumental to achieve my perfect mixture. I wanted the music to point to various moments of my life and to be a part of me. I wanted the flow of the music to be as follows: calm, classical piano, and slowly add more instruments then I wanted to focus on samples that pointed to various moments of my life and then end by returning to the calm, classical piano.
